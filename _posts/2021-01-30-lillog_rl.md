이 글은 OpenAI의 머신 러닝 연구자인 [lilian Weng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dCa-pW8AAAAJ)의 [blog(Lil'log)](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) 글을 번역한 것입니다.

굉장히 글을 잘 쓰셔서 꼭 옮겨적으면서 다시 한 번 개념들을 이해하고 다른 분들께 전달하고 싶어서 번역을 하게 되었습니다.


릴리안의 포스트를 번역하는것은 아래와 같이 그녀에게 이메일로 알려주면 된다고 하는데, 이 글은 아직 비공식 글이기 때문에 우선 번역을 ...해보도록 하겠습니다. (아무도 안볼듯 ㅎ)

```
Q: Can I translate your posts to another language?

A: Yes and my pleasure! But please email me in advance and please keep the original post link on top (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad).
```


## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Say, we have an agent in an unknown environment and this agent can obtain some rewards by interacting with the environment. The agent ought to take actions so as to maximize cumulative rewards. In reality, the scenario could be a bot playing a game to achieve high scores, or a robot trying to complete physical tasks with physical items; and not just limited to these.

*Fig. 1. An agent interacts with the environment, trying to take smart actions to maximize cumulative rewards.*


The goal of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to learn a good strategy for the agent from experimental trials and relative simple feedback received. With the optimal strategy, the agent is capable to actively adapt to the environment to maximize future rewards.
